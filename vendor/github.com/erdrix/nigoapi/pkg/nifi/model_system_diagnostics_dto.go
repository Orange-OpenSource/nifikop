 * NiFi Rest Api
 *
 * The Rest Api provides programmatic access to command and control a NiFi instance in real time. Start and                                              stop processors, monitor queues, query provenance data, and more. Each endpoint below includes a description,                                             definitions of the expected input and output, potential response codes, and the authorizations required                                             to invoke each service.
